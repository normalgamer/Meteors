# Meteors
Welcome to Meteors, a game in which you have to defend the Earth by shooting meteors. The game will be developed in 6502 assembly for the Nintendo Entertainment System

It was just a regular Tuesday, when suddenly, a bazillion meteors were found with a straight trajectory to the Earth. You were chosen to drive the most advanced spaceship to date and destroy those meteors with its plasma cannon. There is a catch, though. Your ship can only shoot 4 projectiles at a time. Will you save the Earth, or fail while being squashed by a meteor? You are the last hope of the planet.

## Why assembly, and why the NES?
The question is simple: why would I start developing a game for a 35 year-old console on almost the most difficult programming language just below binary code?
My answer is, why not?
I like old hardware, because usually it is "simpler". Programming might not be very intuitive, with all the instructions being 3 characters long, but the hardware on these old systems is simpler compared to modern day consoles. It is limited, thus it's simple. You don't have a billion ways of optimizing code, you don't have a bazillion instructions to learn. You have a bucnh of instructions and you gotta use your mind to work around what you want to do. It might look difficult, but it's simpler than what you think!

## Status of the game
Right now, the game is veeery new, you just move the spaceship side to side and shoot 4 plasma projectiles, and that's it.
