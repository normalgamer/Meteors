# Meteors
Welcome to Meteors, a game in which you have to defend the Earth by shooting meteors. The game will be developed in 6502 assembly for the Nintendo Entertainment System

It was just a regular Tuesday, when suddenly, a bazillion meteors were found with a straight trajectory to the Earth. You were chosen to drive the most advanced spaceship to date and destroy those meteors with its plasma cannon. There is a catch, though. Your ship can only shoot 4 projectiles, if you shoot one more the oldest one will disappear. Will you save the Earth, or fail while being squashed by a meteor? You are the last hope of the planet.
